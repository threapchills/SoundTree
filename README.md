# SoundTree
Experimental Organic Audio

Start the drone and grow nodes from the central knob to shape a curved soundscape. Each node introduces a new oscillator tuned to a pentatonic scale so the result remains musical.

After starting, use the "Dark", "Brown", "Pink", "Green" and "White" sliders to sculpt the overall tone. These sliders control a five‑band parametric EQ applied to every oscillator.

Use the **Mirror** button to toggle symmetrical drawing of branches. Right‑click any node to delete it along with its mirrored counterpart.
