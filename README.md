# SoundTree
Experimental Organic Audio

Start the drone and grow nodes from the central knob to shape a curved soundscape. Each node introduces a new oscillator tuned to a pentatonic scale so the result remains musical.

Nodes panned left and right let you craft your own binaural beat textures. Every new connection now throws off glowing particles for a little visual flair.

After starting, use the "Dark", "Brown", "Pink", "Green" and "White" sliders to sculpt the overall tone. These sliders control a fiveâ€‘band parametric EQ applied to every oscillator.
