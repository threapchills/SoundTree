# SoundTree
Experimental Organic Audio

Start the drone and grow nodes from the central knob to shape a curved soundscape. Each node introduces a new oscillator tuned to a pentatonic scale so the result remains musical.

Click **Start** to initialize the audio engine, then drag from the root node to add new branches and shape the tone.

After starting, use the "Dark", "Brown", "Pink", "Green" and "White" sliders to sculpt the overall tone. These sliders control a five‑band parametric EQ applied to every oscillator.

Use the **Mirror** button to toggle symmetrical drawing of branches. Right‑click any node to delete it along with its mirrored counterpart.

A 3D starfield renders behind the canvas, creating a cosmic backdrop for the particle trails as you spawn new nodes.
The visual effects are intentionally subtle so the interactive sound tree remains the focus.
